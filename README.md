# CryptoTradingBot
We are planning on developing a trading bot for use on the Kraken crypto exchange. This bot will perform multiple different trading tasks, most likely not algorithmic trading.

Built by Jack Hancock and Jon Crosse.

TODO List:
- [] Both of us setup Kraken accounts
- [] Get Kraken API working so that we can view public info
- [] Kraken API - view private info
- [] Kraken API - Buy and sell on account
- [] Build skeleton code for project
- [] Use code to allow users to buy/sell through application
- [] Set up connection to Twitter API
- [] Notify when Elon Musk tweets word "doge"
- [] Link bot to buy / sell doge tokens when Elon tweets
